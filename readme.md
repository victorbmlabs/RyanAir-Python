# Ryanair-Python
Based on https://github.com/cohaolain/ryanair-py.

These are my own tweaks to the code to fit my personal use case for the [Dataflight](https://github.com/victorbmlabs/Dataflight) project. If you are going to use this as a module I suggest stripping or editting some of the code to fit your needs.
